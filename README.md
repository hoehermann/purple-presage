A libpurple/Pidgin protocol plugin for Signal (formerly textsecure) using [presage](https://github.com/whisperfish/presage).

Contains code from [flare](https://gitlab.com/schmiddi-on-mobile/flare) by [Schmiddi](https://github.com/Schmiddiii).

## Download

* [Latest Build for Windows](https://nightly.link/hoehermann/purple-presage/workflows/build/master/libpresage.dll.zip)

## Set-up

1. Create a new Pidgin account. Enter your Signal account UUID as username. In case you do not know your UUID, just enter anything. The plug-in will tell you what to use.
2. Enable the connection. A window with the QR-code should pop-up. Scan it with your master device. Wait for the window to close.

Note: bitlbee users will receive the login QR-code in form of a URI from a system contact "Logon QR Code". You may need to allow unsolicited messages from unknown contacts in your client. The URI can be converted using any tool like a local [`qrencode`](https://www.shellhacks.com/qr-code-generator-windows-linux-macos/) or [online services](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) (use at your own risk).

## Features

### Present

* Can link as secondary device via QR-Code.
* Receives a simple text message from a contact or a group.
* Displays quotes, reactions and incoming calls.
* Receives attachments (see caveats below).
* Can send a simple text message or an attachment.
* Will add buddies to contact list unconditionally.
* Can list groups as rooms and open the chat.
* Uses special handling of login procedure for bitlbee.

### Missing

#### To Be Done Soonâ„¢

* Add chats to contact list unconditionally.
* Forward all errors to front-end properly.

#### On Hold

* Mark messages as "read" (currently not implemented in back-end, see https://github.com/whisperfish/presage/issues/141). At time of writing, notifications on main device are deleted after answering via linked device. So that is working alright.
* Reply to a specific message (no example exists in back-end).

#### "Contributions Welcome"

* Configuration option whether to add contacts to buddy list or not
* Reasonable generation of C headers and rust constants
* Stickers, mentions, replies, styles,â€¦
* Display typing notifications
* Display receipts (not important)
* Support for alternative host applications (Spectrum, Bitlbee)
* Support for adding contacts via phone number
* Support receiving contacts (seems to be a dedicated message type)

These lists are not exhaustive.

### Known Issues

* Handling errors when sending messages is barely tested.
* Attachments end up in the conversation of the sender, not the destination (especially confusing when a group chat is involved).
* Failing to send an attachment may bring down the entire application.
* Some message features such as displaying edits do not work reliably, especially on sync messages (send from same account, but other device).
* Sync messages are unreliable, especially in regard to attachments (attachments sent from another device may not be received by the plug-in).
* Some times, the error message `"config_store Err Db(Io(Custom { kind: Other, error: "could not acquire lock on \"â€¦/db\": Os { code: 11, kind: WouldBlock, message: \"Resource temporarily unavailable\" }" }))"` is shown. Just wait a few seconds and try again. Usually, it wors after a couple of retries.

## Building

### Linux

#### Dependencies

* `libpurple-dev`
* `libqrencode-dev`
* `protobuf` (or any other package which provides the `protoc` compiler)

#### Build

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-presage
    mkdir purple-presage/build
    cd purple-presage/build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    sudo cmake --install .

### Windows

purple-presage is known to compile with MSVC 19.30 and rust 1.75. You need the version of rust mentioned in [libsignal-service-rs](https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/tree/main#note-on-supported-rust-versions). A newer version will probably work, too. Using the "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" is recommended.

#### Dependencies

Install dependencies via vcpkg:

    vcpkg.exe install libqrencode:x86-windows-static

protoc needs to be in your PATH. You can install it with any method you like, including vcpkg:

    vcpkg.exe install protobuf

#### Build

Same as Linux build instructions, but may need to modify the configuration:

1. Generate MSBuild project:

        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=WIN32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="â€¦/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x86-windows-static -DRust_CARGO_TARGET="i686-pc-windows-msvc" ..

    If necessary, the rust tool-chain version can be specified via `-DRust_TOOLCHAIN="1.75-i686-pc-windows-msvc"`.

2. Build, Install and Run:

        cmake --build .
        cmake --install . --config Release
        cmake --build . --target run

When using the "Debug" configuration, the linker complains about mismatching configurations. The implications of this are unknown.

#### Notes

purple-presage must be built with MSVC. MinGW's GCC encountered a number of issues such as [incompatibility with rustc versions newer than 1.69](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/112368) and not shipping libbcrypt by default.

Needs a whooping 6 GB of disk space during build! ðŸ˜³
