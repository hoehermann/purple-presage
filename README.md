A proof of concept using [presage](https://github.com/whisperfish/presage) in libpurple.

## Set-up

1. Create a new Pidgin account. Enter your Signal account UUID as username. In case you do not know your UUID, just enter anything. The plug-in will tell you what to use.
2. Enable the connection. A window with the QR-code should pop-up. Scan it with your master device. Wait for the window to close.

## Features

### Present

* Can link against a master device via QR-Code.
* Can receive a simple text message from a contact.
* Can reply with a simple text message.
* Can add contacts to buddy list manually

### Missing

Everything else, most notably:

* Error handling
* Group chat
* Contact management
* Attachments, stickers, mentions, replies, quotes, styles,â€¦
* Support for phone numbers
* Support for alternative UIs

This list is not exhaustive.

### Known Issues

* Own messages sent via other device are displayed as written by contact.
* Sometimes, when sending a message to initiate a conversation, it never reaches destination. Since there is no error handling, the user cannot to know for sure.

## Building

### Linux

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hoehermann/purple-presage
    mkdir purple-presage/build
    cd purple-presage/build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    sudo cmake --install .

### Windows

purple-presage is known to compile with MSVC 19.30 and rust 1.71. Using the "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022" is recommended.

#### Dependencies

Install dependencies via vcpkg:

    vcpkg.exe install libqrencode:x86-windows-static

#### Build

Same as Linux build instructions, but may need to modify:

1. Generate project:

        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=wherever/vcpkg/installed/x86-windows -DRust_CARGO_TARGET="i686-pc-windows-msvc" ..

    If necessary, the rust toolchain version can be specified via `-DRust_TOOLCHAIN="1.69-i686-pc-windows-msvc"`.

2. Build, Install and Run:

        cmake --build .
        cmake --install .
        cmake --build . --target run

#### Notes

purple-presage must be built with MSVC. MinGW's GCC encountered a number of issues such as [incompatibility with rustc versions newer than 1.69](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/112368) and not shipping libbcrypt by default.

Needs a whooping 6 GB of disk space during build! :o
